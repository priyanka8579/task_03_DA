 Retail Orders Database – Querying Fundamentals

**Objective**
 This project demonstrates how to apply fundamental SQL operations to a mock retail dataset (Superstore).
 The goal is to build hands-on skills in querying databases, extracting insights, and practicing real-world SQL use cases.

**Tools Used**
-MySQL Workbench (for database queries)
-Superstore Dataset (sample retail data) from kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vivek468/superstore-dataset-final

**Dataset**
This dataset is a popular sample dataset containing information about sales transactions, customers, and products.
Typical columns include:
-OrderID – unique identifier for each order
-OrderDate, ShipDate – dates of order and shipping
-CustomerID, Segment – customer details
-Region, State, City – geographic info
-ProductID, Category, Sub-Category, ProductName – product details
-Sales, Quantity, Discount, Profit – business metrics

**SQL Concepts Practiced**
1. SELECT – Retrieve specific columns
2. WHERE – Filter rows
3. ORDER BY – Sort results
4. GROUP BY – Aggregate data
5. SELF JOIN – Compare rows within same table

Insights Gained
-Identified top-selling products and regions
-Found loss-making transactions (negative profit)
-Aggregated sales and profit by category and region
-Learned how to compare orders by the same customer using self-joins
